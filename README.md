```markdown
Functions in Kayte Lang are defined using the `function` keyword.

```kayte
function greet() {
    print("Hello, World from Kayte Lang!");
}
```

### 2. Variable Declaration

Variables are declared using the `var` keyword.

```kayte
var name = "Kayte Lang";
```

### 3. Conditional Logic

Conditional statements are handled using `if` and `else`.

```kayte
if (name == "Kayte Lang") {
    print("Welcome to Kayte Lang!");
} else {
    print("Unknown language");
}
```

### 4. Loops

Kayte Lang supports `for` loops for iteration.

```kayte
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print(i);
}
```

### 5. Error Handling

Error handling is done using `try` and `catch` blocks.

```kayte
try {
    var result = riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
    print("An error occurred: " + error);
}
```

## Example: A Simple Kayte Lang Script

Here's an example of a simple UI script written in Kayte Lang:

```kayte
window main {
  title: "Kayte Lang Demo"
  width: 800
  height: 600
  
  content {
    button {
      id: "btnClickMe"
      text: "Click Me!"
      onclick: showMessage()
    }
  }
}

function showMessage() {
  print("Button clicked!");
}
```

This script defines a basic window with a button that prints "Button clicked!" to the console when clicked.

## Bytecode Compilation and Execution

Kayte Lang compiles its source files into bytecode, which is then executed by the Kayte Virtual Machine. The VM ensures cross-platform compatibility and optimized performance.

### Bytecode Example

Below is an example of how a Kayte Lang script gets compiled into bytecode.

```plaintext
BYTECODE INSTRUCTION SAMPLE:
LOAD_CONST   0 (Button clicked!)
CALL_FUNCTION 1
RETURN_VALUE
```

This makes it possible to run Kayte Lang scripts efficiently on multiple platforms without the overhead of high-level interpretation.

## UI Component Definition

One of the standout features of Kayte Lang is its ability to define UI components using XML and DTD. This method ensures that the UI is both structured and easily maintainable.

```xml
<window title="Kayte Lang UI" width="800" height="600">
  <button id="btnHello" text="Say Hello" onclick="sayHello()" />
</window>
```

With this structured format, complex UIs can be built and maintained in a consistent and readable way.

## Roadmap for Kayte Lang

Kayte Lang is currently in its Proof of Concept phase, but there are ambitious plans for future development, including:

- **Advanced Type System**: Adding support for a stronger type system to improve safety and performance.
- **Optimized VM**: Further enhancements to the Kayte VM to boost speed and efficiency.
- **Standard Libraries**: Expanding Kayte Langâ€™s ecosystem with libraries for common tasks like file handling, networking, and more.
- **Cross-Platform UI Toolkit**: Developing a unified UI framework to build applications for multiple platforms with a single codebase.
